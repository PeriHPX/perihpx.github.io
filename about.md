The non local models organization is a collaboration of [researchers](/team) developing a simulation code for various non local models, e.g. [peridynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridynamics). The code is released on [github](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels) under [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalmodels.github.io.svg)](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalmodels.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) and [build tools](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/buildscripts) for an ease installation are available.

The code uses the C++ standard library for parallism and concurrency ([HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP)) for its parallel and distributed implementation.
