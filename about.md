The PeriHPX organization is a collaboration of [researchers](/team) developing a simulation code for various non local models, e.g. [peridynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridynamics). 

The code [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/PeriHPX/PeriHPX.svg)](https://GitHub.com/PeriHPX/PeriHPX/releases/) is released on [GitHub](https://github.com/PeriHPX) using [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/PeriHPX/PeriHPX.svg)](https://github.com/PeriHPX/PeriHPX/blob/main/LICENSE). The main branch has the status [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nonlocalmodels/NLMech.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalheatequation). The code quality of the main branch is [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/dba3a9de609941adad34f3a49e3b813c)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/PeriHPX/PeriHPX/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=PeriHPX/PeriHPX&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) and the test coverage is [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nonlocalmodels/NLMech?branch=master). We have [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/PeriHPX/PeriHPX.svg)](https://github.com/PeriHPX/PeriHpx/issues).

The latest documentation is available [here](https://perihpx.github.io/documentation/).

The code uses the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency ([HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP)) for its parallel and distributed implementation. For more details, we refer to [![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02352/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02352).
