Finally, the code has a new logo combining the words Peridynamic and HPX, 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeriHPX/artwork/main/PNG/perihpx_logo.png" alt="logo" width="400"/></p>

Note that the colors of the word HPX match the colors of the HPX logo. This logo shows nicely that the code implements peridynamics and is accelerated by HPX.
